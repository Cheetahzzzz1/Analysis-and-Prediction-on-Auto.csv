# Analysis and Prediction on Auto.csv

# Overview

This notebook implements an exploratory data analysis and predictive modeling assignment focused on the "Auto" dataset. The analysis includes data preprocessing,feature engineering and building models to predict car attributes based on fuel efficiency.

# Project Description

The assignment focuses on:

1. Exploring the relationship between features such as weight, horsepower, displacement and fuel efficiency (miles per gallon, mpg).

2. Creating a binary classifcation variable (mpg01) based on whether a car's mpg is above or below the median value.

3. Splitting the dataset into training and test sets for predictive analysis.

4. Building and evaluating machine learning models, including k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN) to classify cars based on fuel efficiency.
